To provide adequate capacity to discharge treated effluent from Banora WWTP to Terranora Inlet for the current and ultimate plant capacity.\r\nProject Background:  The Banora Point WWTP was constructed to its current design capacity of 62,500 EP (15 ML/day) in 1995.  The plant is currently being upgraded to a capacity of 75,000 EP (18ML/d) with completion expected mid-2012.  The ultimate capacity of the plant is planned to be 125,000EP.\r\n \r\nTreated effluent from the plant is discharged to the Terranora Inlet at the Dry Dock, located on Dry Dock Road, Tweed Heads South.  Effluent is discharged from the plant to the outfall through approximately 1.7km of DN750 RCP.  A pumping lift station is located midway along the outfall pipeline.\r\n \r\nDischarge of effluent to the Terranora Inlet is restricted to a 4 hour window commencing 1 hour before each high tide and 3 hours following high tide.  This requirement is in place to maximise tidal discharge flushing and minimise nutrient accumulation within the Terranora Inlet. The plant currently operates to attenuate effluent flow within an effluent holding lagoon. The effluent holding lagoon is sized to contain 3 x ADWF.\r\n \r\nIt has been identified in Effluent Release System Hydraulic Review (MWH,2009) that the existing effluent outfall system has insufficient capacity to service current and future effluent flows.\r\n \r\nA realignment of a section of the existing DN750 outfall is proposed to be completed as part of Kirkwood Rd Interchange works scheduled to commence late 2011.  This realignment is not expected to significantly alter the existing outfall capacity.\r\n \r\nSignificant roadworks are planned around the existing Pacific Highway and Kirkwood Rd.  Additional bridge crossings of Terranora Ck are also proposed in future.  A concept design of the ultimate Highway and Kirkwood Rd interchange has been completed (by TSC).  A concept alignment for the location of a new Effluent Outfall Pipeline has been identified with respect to future roadworks.  The pipeline is proposed to be located on the north side of the highway then crossing back under the highway on Dry Dock Rd and discharging at the current outfall location.  This alignment would be considered the preferred alignment for any new pipeline option.",

Class B (6m wide seal) rural standard cross section (unless approved otherwise). Any culverts that are nearing the end of their service life may also be replaced (if within budget).\r\nProject Background:\r\nThe main access road for the Tweed valley sugarcane fields is Tweed Valley Way. Safety barriers installed along the centre of the road prevent turning movements for cane haulage trucks into the cane pads where harvested cane is stored. To access these pads the trucks must travel an increased distance along Tweed Valley Way to designated intersections where U-turns can be made. These truck movements present an increased risk of vehicle collision caused by the mixing of low speed accelerating/decelerating haul trucks with high speed through traffic.  Access to some cane pads located more remote from the main road is also affected by the available turning points through the safety barrier and is forced into a convoluted route.The net effect is excess travel time and distance for the haulage of cane from this area to the Condong Sugar Mill, and compromised road safety.An alternative route would be to utilise Bartletts Road. Use of this road would reduce travel distances and time, and minimize the number of truck turning and accelerating/decelerating movements on Tweed Valley Way. The intersection of Bartletts Road and Tweed Valley Way already includes a vehicle right turning/storage lane.  However, Bartletts Road is partially unsealed (2km). The unsealed section of the road is unsuitable for heavy transport, particularly during wet weather.\r\nExclusions:\r\nOther areas of Bartletts Road. Bridges on Bartletts Road (replaced in separate project)",

Multiple complaints from residents and motorists have been received by council. The issue has been on the Local Traffic Committee agenda since August 2009. Initially, efforts were made to change the intersection to a roundabout design, this was not feasible due to spatial constraints. A signalised intersection design was then proposed but the estimated $350 000 budget required was unable to be procured via the 'Black Spot' funding program as the intersection and crash history did not meet the requirements. Four design options, achievable within the budget and spatial constraints, were put to the Local Traffic Committee on 22 March 2012 for discussion. The committee agreed on an option and resolved to move towards a detailed design.",

The pipes are easily blocked, which causes the culvert to function as a causeway. Mt Warning road provides access to the National Park and Mountain which is one of the major tourism generators for the region. It also provides access to a number of businesses which rely on visitors access (such as Mavis's kitchen). When the culvert functions as a causeway, visitors are not able to access, or deterred from accessing, theses facilites/businesses.\r\nExclusions:\r\nOther locations on Mt Warning Road.\r\n",

The amount of works to be undertaken will only be to allow the drainage canal to drain properly to Trutes Bay. The Gross Pollutant Trap before the outlet will also need to be cleaned as well. Any revegetation as part of the conditions set for mangrove clearing will also be undertaken.\r\nProject Background:  The outlet canal from a large underground urban stormwater system has become silted up and requires cleaning out. However the outlet canal drains through State Crown Land into Trutes Bay (Terranora Broadwater) and would require approximately 350m2 of mangrove habitat clearing. \r\n \r\nFrom previous investigation works conducted in 2010 a costly  Environmental Impact Assessment would be required to be undertaken from the Dept of Planning and potentially mangrove rehabilitation would be required elsewhere as compensation at a rate of 1:10. Also there was previously a drain (visible from 1960 and 1970s aerial imagery) that was maintained by the land owner prior to subdivision.  \r\n \r\nThe field inlet pit on western side of Frazer Drive (65m from outlet) is almost completely full which indicates that water is backing up the stormwater system and is not escaping. Also in the past the neighbouring residents have complained about mosquito breeding in the outlet canal due to water being so stagnant and TSC have to continually perform spraying in the area.",

Detail requirements for Water Unit M and E section to procure and install.\r\nLiaise with Water Unit M and E section to determine specification requirements  to tender and procure suitable Chlorine Analyser.\r\nPrepare specification, tender and provide tender assessment of skid mounted hypochlorite dosing system (see below).\r\nProvide a Concept Design Report (may be part of Safety in Design Report).\r\n \r\nOther Dosing System Requirements and considerations\r\n\r\nLiquid Sodium Hypochlorite is to be the only chemical considered.\r\nDosing systems must be flow paced\r\nChlorine residual monitoring should be included in the installation\r\nResidual monitoring will be used for alarm and shutdown control only\r\nCheck existence/suitability of an existing flow meter (location, type, outputs, etc)  \r\nLiaise with Operations Engineer to determine any proposed adjustments to Reservoir control settings\r\nAppropriate chemical safety and signage requirements\r\nIf the dosing facility cannot be housed in the existing pump shed, it shall be housed in a kit style shed, with the concept and final designs providing the overall required shed size/layout, including the position and details of all openings (personal access doors, roller doors, windows, roof ventilation, etc.). Detailed design of shed and slab is not required.\r\nShed lighting, GPO's, water supply, etc.  \r\n \r\nA technical specification is to be prepared to include in tender documentation for the design and construction of the hypochlorite system. The technical specification should be suitably detailed to allow for the tendering and procurement of the required packaged Duty/Standby Liquid Sodium Hypochlorite Dosing System, along with relevant other components and equipment to be purchased.    \r\n \r\nThe specification will define the necessary performance requirements for the overall dosing systems and feed in decisions reached in the concept design phase. This shall include; \r\n\r\nControl Functional Specification\r\nTypical General Arrangement\r\nDosing Line Run Drawings\r\n \r\n \r\nDosing should be sized to achieve maximum of 1mg/L at peak flow.\r\nThe dosing system will be attended a minimum of once per week by operational staff.  Operational staff can supply and decant chlorine from 25L containers.  Appropriate delivery mechanism to be determined. Bulk chemical delivery may not be available under TSC's existing chemical supply contract.\r\n \r\nBase dosing size on 10 percent w/v hypochlorite strength.  This allows for some chlorine degradation as the chemical is delivered at a nominal 12.5 percent w/v.\r\n \r\nPackage system should include for degassing.\r\n \r\nPumps should be provided with 240v GPO plugs to allow easy changeover.\r\n \r\nTSC Designer will be responsible to confirm any tendered package dosing systems meets the control requirements as detailed in the functional description.  PID drawing will need to be updated to incorporate the package system controls.\r\n \r\nIt is anticipated that the package dosing system and instrumentation will be installed and commissioned by the Water Unit.  The Water Unit will procure the shed and slab if required.\r\nExclusions:  Injection rate control by downstream monitoring\r\nBuilding/shelter detailed design (concept only required as per scope, and only if needed).",

This task will include the following key elements:\r\n\r\nGather information on chlorine demand and decay in the existing system.\r\nGather information on expected current and future water demands (minimum, typical and peak) \r\nObtain site plans and drawing of existing infrastructure.\r\nSizing of a packaged dosing facility for current and future needs.\r\nEnsure adequate mixing and chlorine detention times.\r\nDetermine if existing pump building can house the dosing system (if applicable). \r\nInvestigation of hypochlorite storage and supply issues.  Storages need to be sized to prevent degradation of hypochlorite but also to minimise purchase and delivery costs. Liaise with Water Operations with regards to existing and preferred methods of chemical supply and contracts.\r\nIdentify layout and design requirements that need to be adopted to ensure the facility operates effectively and without operational issues.\r\nDesign of dosing point\r\nDetermine safety measures required (including if a safety shower / eye wash station is required)\r\nIdentify any civil or other site issues.\r\nAddress site services, including electrical supply.\r\nPrepare PID and control functional description for operation of the dosing system. Liaise with Water Unit Operations area to determine control functional requirements.\r\nDetermine SCADA and PLC control requirements.  Detail requirements for Water Unit M and E section to procure and install.\r\nLiaise with Water Unit M and E section to determine specification requirements  to tender and procure suitable Chlorine Analyser.\r\nPrepare specification, tender and provide tender assessment of skid mounted hypochlorite dosing system (see below).\r\nProvide a Concept Design Report (may be part of Safety in Design Report).\r\n \r\nOther Dosing System Requirements and considerations\r\n\r\nLiquid Sodium Hypochlorite is to be the only chemical considered.\r\nDosing systems must be flow paced\r\nChlorine residual monitoring should be included in the installation\r\nResidual monitoring will be used for alarm and shutdown control only\r\nCheck existence/suitability of an existing flow meter (location, type, outputs, etc)  \r\nLiaise with Operations Engineer to determine any proposed adjustments to Reservoir control settings\r\nAppropriate chemical safety and signage requirements\r\nIf the dosing facility cannot be housed in the existing pump shed, it shall be housed in a kit style shed, with the concept and final designs providing the overall required shed size/layout, including the position and details of all openings (personal access doors, roller doors, windows, roof ventilation, etc.). Detailed design of shed and slab is not required.\r\nShed lighting, GPO's, water supply, etc.  \r\n \r\nA technical specification is to be prepared to include in tender documentation for the design and construction of the hypochlorite system. The technical specification should be suitably detailed to allow for the tendering and procurement of the required packaged Duty/Standby Liquid Sodium Hypochlorite Dosing System, along with relevant other components and equipment to be purchased.    \r\n \r\nThe specification will define the necessary performance requirements for the overall dosing systems and feed in decisions reached in the concept design phase. This shall include; \r\n\r\nControl Functional Specification\r\nTypical General Arrangement\r\nDosing Line Run Drawings\r\n \r\n \r\nDosing should be sized to achieve maximum of 1mg/L at peak flow.\r\nThe dosing system will be attended a minimum of once per week by operational staff.  Operational staff can supply and decant chlorine from 25L containers.  Appropriate delivery mechanism to be determined. Bulk chemical delivery may not be available under TSC's existing chemical supply contract.\r\n \r\nBase dosing size on 10 percent w/v hypochlorite strength.  This allows for some chlorine degradation as the chemical is delivered at a nominal 12.5 percent w/v.\r\n \r\nPackage system should include for degassing.\r\n \r\nPumps should be provided with 240v GPO plugs to allow easy changeover.\r\n \r\nTSC Designer will be responsible to confirm any tendered package dosing systems meets the control requirements as detailed in the functional description.  PID drawing will need to be updated to incorporate the package system controls.\r\n \r\nIt is anticipated that the package dosing system and instrumentation will be installed and commissioned by the Water Unit.

The Casino-Murwillumbah rail corridor was closed to rolling stock in 2004. In 2013 Transport NSW released its findings from the Casino to Murwillumbah Transport Study effectively killing off any plans for a return of rail services. This opened the door to convert the corridor to a 'rail trail' for use by cyclists and pedestrians. \r\n \r\nThe Tweed Stage of the Northern Rivers Rail Trail was identified as Council's second preference project for funding under the National Stronger Regions Fund Round 2 (behind the Kingscliff Foreshore Protection and Revitalisation Project).",

To provide adequate capacity to discharge treated effluent from Banora WWTP to Terranora Inlet for the current and ultimate plant capacity.\r\nProject Background:  The Banora Point WWTP was constructed to its current design capacity of 62,500 EP (15 ML/day) in 1995.  The plant is currently being upgraded to a capacity of 75,000 EP (18ML/d) with completion expected mid-2012.  The ultimate capacity of the plant is planned to be 125,000EP.\r\n \r\nTreated effluent from the plant is discharged to the Terranora Inlet at the Dry Dock, located on Dry Dock Road, Tweed Heads South.  Effluent is discharged from the plant to the outfall through approximately 1.7km of DN750 RCP.  A pumping lift station is located midway along the outfall pipeline.\r\n \r\nDischarge of effluent to the Terranora Inlet is restricted to a 4 hour window commencing 1 hour before each high tide and 3 hours following high tide.  This requirement is in place to maximise tidal discharge flushing and minimise nutrient accumulation within the Terranora Inlet. The plant currently operates to attenuate effluent flow within an effluent holding lagoon. The effluent holding lagoon is sized to contain 3 x ADWF.\r\n \r\nIt has been identified in Effluent Release System Hydraulic Review (MWH,2009) that the existing effluent outfall system has insufficient capacity to service current and future effluent flows.\r\n \r\nA realignment of a section of the existing DN750 outfall is proposed to be completed as part of Kirkwood Rd Interchange works scheduled to commence late 2011.  This realignment is not expected to significantly alter the existing outfall capacity.\r\n \r\nSignificant roadworks are planned around the existing Pacific Highway and Kirkwood Rd.  Additional bridge crossings of Terranora Ck are also proposed in future.  A concept design of the ultimate Highway and Kirkwood Rd interchange has been completed (by TSC).  A concept alignment for the location of a new Effluent Outfall Pipeline has been identified with respect to future roadworks.  The pipeline is proposed to be located on the north side of the highway then crossing back under the highway on Dry Dock Rd and discharging at the current outfall location.  This alignment would be considered the preferred alignment for any new pipeline option.",

Class B (6m wide seal) rural standard cross section (unless approved otherwise). Any culverts that are nearing the end of their service life may also be replaced (if within budget).\r\nProject Background:\r\nThe main access road for the Tweed valley sugarcane fields is Tweed Valley Way. Safety barriers installed along the centre of the road prevent turning movements for cane haulage trucks into the cane pads where harvested cane is stored. To access these pads the trucks must travel an increased distance along Tweed Valley Way to designated intersections where U-turns can be made. These truck movements present an increased risk of vehicle collision caused by the mixing of low speed accelerating/decelerating haul trucks with high speed through traffic.  Access to some cane pads located more remote from the main road is also affected by the available turning points through the safety barrier and is forced into a convoluted route.The net effect is excess travel time and distance for the haulage of cane from this area to the Condong Sugar Mill, and compromised road safety.An alternative route would be to utilise Bartletts Road. Use of this road would reduce travel distances and time, and minimize the number of truck turning and accelerating/decelerating movements on Tweed Valley Way. The intersection of Bartletts Road and Tweed Valley Way already includes a vehicle right turning/storage lane.  However, Bartletts Road is partially unsealed (2km). The unsealed section of the road is unsuitable for heavy transport, particularly during wet weather.\r\nExclusions:\r\nOther areas of Bartletts Road. Bridges on Bartletts Road (replaced in separate project)",

Initially, efforts were made to change the intersection to a roundabout design, this was not feasible due to spatial constraints. A signalised intersection design was then proposed but the estimated $350 000 budget required was unable to be procured via the 'Black Spot' funding program as the intersection and crash history did not meet the requirements. Four design options, achievable within the budget and spatial constraints, were put to the Local Traffic Committee on 22 March 2012 for discussion. The committee agreed on an option and resolved to move towards a detailed design.",

The amount of works to be undertaken will only be to allow the drainage canal to drain properly to Trutes Bay. The Gross Pollutant Trap before the outlet will also need to be cleaned as well. Any revegetation as part of the conditions set for mangrove clearing will also be undertaken.\r\nProject Background:  The outlet canal from a large underground urban stormwater system has become silted up and requires cleaning out. However the outlet canal drains through State Crown Land into Trutes Bay (Terranora Broadwater) and would require approximately 350m2 of mangrove habitat clearing. \r\n \r\nFrom previous investigation works conducted in 2010 a costly  Environmental Impact Assessment would be required to be undertaken from the Dept of Planning and potentially mangrove rehabilitation would be required elsewhere as compensation at a rate of 1:10. Also there was previously a drain (visible from 1960 and 1970s aerial imagery) that was maintained by the land owner prior to subdivision.  \r\n \r\nThe field inlet pit on western side of Frazer Drive (65m from outlet) is almost completely full which indicates that water is backing up the stormwater system and is not escaping. Also in the past the neighbouring residents have complained about mosquito breeding in the outlet canal due to water being so stagnant and TSC have to continually perform spraying in the area.",

Storages need to be sized to prevent degradation of hypochlorite but also to minimise purchase and delivery costs. Liaise with Water Operations with regards to existing and preferred methods of chemical supply and contracts.\r\nIdentify layout and design requirements that need to be adopted to ensure the facility operates effectively and without operational issues.\r\nDesign of dosing point\r\nDetermine safety measures required (including if a safety shower / eye wash station is required)\r\nIdentify any civil or other site issues.\r\nAddress site services, including electrical supply.\r\nPrepare PID and control functional description for operation of the dosing system. Liaise with Water Unit Operations area to determine control functional requirements.\r\nDetermine SCADA and PLC control requirements.  Detail requirements for Water Unit M and E section to procure and install.\r\nLiaise with Water Unit M and E section to determine specification requirements  to tender and procure suitable Chlorine Analyser.\r\nPrepare specification, tender and provide tender assessment of skid mounted hypochlorite dosing system (see below).\r\nProvide a Concept Design Report (may be part of Safety in Design Report).\r\n \r\nOther Dosing System Requirements and considerations\r\n\r\nLiquid Sodium Hypochlorite is to be the only chemical considered.\r\nDosing systems must be flow paced\r\nChlorine residual monitoring should be included in the installation\r\nResidual monitoring will be used for alarm and shutdown control only\r\nCheck existence/suitability of an existing flow meter (location, type, outputs, etc)  \r\nLiaise with Operations Engineer to determine any proposed adjustments to Reservoir control settings\r\nAppropriate chemical safety and signage requirements\r\nIf the dosing facility cannot be housed in the existing pump shed, it shall be housed in a kit style shed, with the concept and final designs providing the overall required shed size/layout, including the position and details of all openings (personal access doors, roller doors, windows, roof ventilation, etc.). Detailed design of shed and slab is not required.\r\nShed lighting, GPO's, water supply, etc.  \r\n \r\nA technical specification is to be prepared to include in tender documentation for the design and construction of the hypochlorite system. The technical specification should be suitably detailed to allow for the tendering and procurement of the required packaged Duty/Standby Liquid Sodium Hypochlorite Dosing System, along with relevant other components and equipment to be purchased.    \r\n \r\nThe specification will define the necessary performance requirements for the overall dosing systems and feed in decisions reached in the concept design phase. This shall include; \r\n\r\nControl Functional Specification\r\nTypical General Arrangement\r\nDosing Line Run Drawings\r\n \r\n \r\nDosing should be sized to achieve maximum of 1mg/L at peak flow.\r\nThe dosing system will be attended a minimum of once per week by operational staff.  Operational staff can supply and decant chlorine from 25L containers.  Appropriate delivery mechanism to be determined. Bulk chemical delivery may not be available under TSC's existing chemical supply contract.\r\n \r\nBase dosing size on 10 percent w/v hypochlorite strength.  This allows for some chlorine degradation as the chemical is delivered at a nominal 12.5 percent w/v.\r\n \r\nPackage system should include for degassing.\r\n \r\nPumps should be provided with 240v GPO plugs to allow easy changeover.\r\n \r\nTSC Designer will be responsible to confirm any tendered package dosing systems meets the control requirements as detailed in the functional description.  PID drawing will need to be updated to incorporate the package system controls.\r\n \r\nIt is anticipated that the package dosing system and instrumentation will be installed and commissioned by the Water Unit.  The Water Unit will procure the shed and slab if required.\r\nExclusions:  Injection rate control by downstream monitoring\r\nBuilding/shelter detailed design (concept only required as per scope, and only if needed).",

Due to the long residence time of the system, chlorination at points throughout the network cannot be avoided. \r\n \r\nA determination of locations for chlorine booster stations has been made based on information from residual monitoring and water age modelling. It has been determined that the Hillcrest Reservoir is a high priority location requiring a chlorine booster station.\r\n \r\nAt a \"Water Age and Chlorine Residual Review\" meeting attended by Water Unit Senior Engineers and Water Manager in December 2014 it was agreed that Sodium Hypochlorite will be the only chemical considered, that the dosing systems must be flow paced, that chlorine residual monitoring should be included in the installation, and that residual monitoring would be used as alarm and shutdown control only.

This task will include the following key elements:\r\n\r\nGather information on chlorine demand and decay in the existing system.\r\nGather information on expected current and future water demands (minimum, typical and peak) \r\nObtain site plans and drawing of existing infrastructure.\r\nSizing of a packaged dosing facility for current and future needs.\r\nEnsure adequate mixing and chlorine detention times.\r\nDetermine if existing pump building can house the dosing system (if applicable). \r\nInvestigation of hypochlorite storage and supply issues.  Storages need to be sized to prevent degradation of hypochlorite but also to minimise purchase and delivery costs. Liaise with Water Operations with regards to existing and preferred methods of chemical supply and contracts.\r\nIdentify layout and design requirements that need to be adopted to ensure the facility operates effectively and without operational issues.\r\nDesign of dosing point\r\nDetermine safety measures required (including if a safety shower / eye wash station is required)\r\nIdentify any civil or other site issues.\r\nAddress site services, including electrical supply.\r\nPrepare PID and control functional description for operation of the dosing system. Liaise with Water Unit Operations area to determine control functional requirements.\r\nDetermine SCADA and PLC control requirements.  Detail requirements for Water Unit M and E section to procure and install.\r\nLiaise with Water Unit M and E section to determine specification requirements  to tender and procure suitable Chlorine Analyser.\r\nPrepare specification, tender and provide tender assessment of skid mounted hypochlorite dosing system (see below).\r\nProvide a Concept Design Report (may be part of Safety in Design Report).\r\n \r\nOther Dosing System Requirements and considerations\r\n\r\nLiquid Sodium Hypochlorite is to be the only chemical considered.\r\nDosing systems must be flow paced\r\nChlorine residual monitoring should be included in the installation\r\nResidual monitoring will be used for alarm and shutdown control only\r\nCheck existence/suitability of an existing flow meter (location, type, outputs, etc)  \r\nLiaise with Operations Engineer to determine any proposed adjustments to Reservoir control settings\r\nAppropriate chemical safety and signage requirements\r\nIf the dosing facility cannot be housed in the existing pump shed, it shall be housed in a kit style shed, with the concept and final designs providing the overall required shed size/layout, including the position and details of all openings (personal access doors, roller doors, windows, roof ventilation, etc.). Detailed design of shed and slab is not required.\r\nShed lighting, GPO's, water supply, etc.  \r\n \r\nA technical specification is to be prepared to include in tender documentation for the design and construction of the hypochlorite system. The technical specification should be suitably detailed to allow for the tendering and procurement of the required packaged Duty/Standby Liquid Sodium Hypochlorite Dosing System, along with relevant other components and equipment to be purchased.    \r\n \r\nThe specification will define the necessary performance requirements for the overall dosing systems and feed in decisions reached in the concept design phase. This shall include; \r\n\r\nControl Functional Specification\r\nTypical General Arrangement\r\nDosing Line Run Drawings\r\n \r\n \r\nDosing should be sized to achieve maximum of 1mg/L at peak flow.\r\nThe dosing system will be attended a minimum of once per week by operational staff.  Operational staff can supply and decant chlorine from 25L containers.  Appropriate delivery mechanism to be determined. Bulk chemical delivery may not be available under TSC's existing chemical supply contract.\r\n \r\nBase dosing size on 10 percent w/v hypochlorite strength.  This allows for some chlorine degradation as the chemical is delivered at a nominal 12.5 percent w/v.\r\n \r\nPackage system should include for degassing.\r\n \r\nPumps should be provided with 240v GPO plugs to allow easy changeover.\r\n \r\nTSC Designer will be responsible to confirm any tendered package dosing systems meets the control requirements as detailed in the functional description.  PID drawing will need to be updated to incorporate the package system controls.\r\n \r\nIt is anticipated that the package dosing system and instrumentation will be installed and commissioned by the Water Unit.  The Water Unit will procure the shed and slab if required.",

The Casino-Murwillumbah rail corridor was closed to rolling stock in 2004. In 2013 Transport NSW released its findings from the Casino to Murwillumbah Transport Study effectively killing off any plans for a return of rail services. This opened the door to convert the corridor to a 'rail trail' for use by cyclists and pedestrians. \r\n \r\nThe Tweed Stage of the Northern Rivers Rail Trail was identified as Council's second preference project for funding under the National Stronger Regions Fund Round 2 (behind the Kingscliff Foreshore Protection and Revitalisation Project).",

To provide adequate capacity to discharge treated effluent from Banora WWTP to Terranora Inlet for the current and ultimate plant capacity.\r\nProject Background:  The Banora Point WWTP was constructed to its current design capacity of 62,500 EP (15 ML/day) in 1995.  The plant is currently being upgraded to a capacity of 75,000 EP (18ML/d) with completion expected mid-2012.  The ultimate capacity of the plant is planned to be 125,000EP.\r\n \r\nTreated effluent from the plant is discharged to the Terranora Inlet at the Dry Dock, located on Dry Dock Road, Tweed Heads South.  Effluent is discharged from the plant to the outfall through approximately 1.7km of DN750 RCP.  A pumping lift station is located midway along the outfall pipeline.\r\n \r\nDischarge of effluent to the Terranora Inlet is restricted to a 4 hour window commencing 1 hour before each high tide and 3 hours following high tide.  This requirement is in place to maximise tidal discharge flushing and minimise nutrient accumulation within the Terranora Inlet. The plant currently operates to attenuate effluent flow within an effluent holding lagoon. The effluent holding lagoon is sized to contain 3 x ADWF.\r\n \r\nIt has been identified in Effluent Release System Hydraulic Review (MWH,2009) that the existing effluent outfall system has insufficient capacity to service current and future effluent flows.\r\n \r\nA realignment of a section of the existing DN750 outfall is proposed to be completed as part of Kirkwood Rd Interchange works scheduled to commence late 2011.  This realignment is not expected to significantly alter the existing outfall capacity.\r\n \r\nSignificant roadworks are planned around the existing Pacific Highway and Kirkwood Rd.  Additional bridge crossings of Terranora Ck are also proposed in future.  A concept design of the ultimate Highway and Kirkwood Rd interchange has been completed (by TSC).  A concept alignment for the location of a new Effluent Outfall Pipeline has been identified with respect to future roadworks.  The pipeline is proposed to be located on the north side of the highway then crossing back under the highway on Dry Dock Rd and discharging at the current outfall location.  This alignment would be considered the preferred alignment for any new pipeline option.",

Class B (6m wide seal) rural standard cross section (unless approved otherwise). Any culverts that are nearing the end of their service life may also be replaced (if within budget).\r\nProject Background:\r\nThe main access road for the Tweed valley sugarcane fields is Tweed Valley Way. Safety barriers installed along the centre of the road prevent turning movements for cane haulage trucks into the cane pads where harvested cane is stored. To access these pads the trucks must travel an increased distance along Tweed Valley Way to designated intersections where U-turns can be made. These truck movements present an increased risk of vehicle collision caused by the mixing of low speed accelerating/decelerating haul trucks with high speed through traffic.  Access to some cane pads located more remote from the main road is also affected by the available turning points through the safety barrier and is forced into a convoluted route.The net effect is excess travel time and distance for the haulage of cane from this area to the Condong Sugar Mill, and compromised road safety.An alternative route would be to utilise Bartletts Road. Use of this road would reduce travel distances and time, and minimize the number of truck turning and accelerating/decelerating movements on Tweed Valley Way. The intersection of Bartletts Road and Tweed Valley Way already includes a vehicle right turning/storage lane.  However, Bartletts Road is partially unsealed (2km). The unsealed section of the road is unsuitable for heavy transport, particularly during wet weather.\r\nExclusions:\r\nOther areas of Bartletts Road.

Multiple complaints from residents and motorists have been received by council. The issue has been on the Local Traffic Committee agenda since August 2009. Initially, efforts were made to change the intersection to a roundabout design, this was not feasible due to spatial constraints. A signalised intersection design was then proposed but the estimated $350 000 budget required was unable to be procured via the 'Black Spot' funding program as the intersection and crash history did not meet the requirements. Four design options, achievable within the budget and spatial constraints, were put to the Local Traffic Committee on 22 March 2012 for discussion. The committee agreed on an option and resolved to move towards a detailed design.",

The pipes are easily blocked, which causes the culvert to function as a causeway.

It also provides access to a number of businesses which rely on visitors access (such as Mavis's kitchen).

The amount of works to be undertaken will only be to allow the drainage canal to drain properly to Trutes Bay. The Gross Pollutant Trap before the outlet will also need to be cleaned as well. Any revegetation as part of the conditions set for mangrove clearing will also be undertaken.\r\nProject Background:  The outlet canal from a large underground urban stormwater system has become silted up and requires cleaning out. However the outlet canal drains through State Crown Land into Trutes Bay (Terranora Broadwater) and would require approximately 350m2 of mangrove habitat clearing. \r\n \r\nFrom previous investigation works conducted in 2010 a costly  Environmental Impact Assessment would be required to be undertaken from the Dept of Planning and potentially mangrove rehabilitation would be required elsewhere as compensation at a rate of 1:10. Also there was previously a drain (visible from 1960 and 1970s aerial imagery) that was maintained by the land owner prior to subdivision.  \r\n \r\nThe field inlet pit on western side of Frazer Drive (65m from outlet) is almost completely full which indicates that water is backing up the stormwater system and is not escaping. Also in the past the neighbouring residents have complained about mosquito breeding in the outlet canal due to water being so stagnant and TSC have to continually perform spraying in the area.",

Detail requirements for Water Unit M and E section to procure and install.\r\nLiaise with Water Unit M and E section to determine specification requirements  to tender and procure suitable Chlorine Analyser.\r\nPrepare specification, tender and provide tender assessment of skid mounted hypochlorite dosing system (see below).\r\nProvide a Concept Design Report (may be part of Safety in Design Report).\r\n \r\nOther Dosing System Requirements and considerations\r\n\r\nLiquid Sodium Hypochlorite is to be the only chemical considered.\r\nDosing systems must be flow paced\r\nChlorine residual monitoring should be included in the installation\r\nResidual monitoring will be used for alarm and shutdown control only\r\nCheck existence/suitability of an existing flow meter (location, type, outputs, etc)  \r\nLiaise with Operations Engineer to determine any proposed adjustments to Reservoir control settings\r\nAppropriate chemical safety and signage requirements\r\nIf the dosing facility cannot be housed in the existing pump shed, it shall be housed in a kit style shed, with the concept and final designs providing the overall required shed size/layout, including the position and details of all openings (personal access doors, roller doors, windows, roof ventilation, etc.). Detailed design of shed and slab is not required.\r\nShed lighting, GPO's, water supply, etc.  \r\n \r\nA technical specification is to be prepared to include in tender documentation for the design and construction of the hypochlorite system. The technical specification should be suitably detailed to allow for the tendering and procurement of the required packaged Duty/Standby Liquid Sodium Hypochlorite Dosing System, along with relevant other components and equipment to be purchased.    \r\n \r\nThe specification will define the necessary performance requirements for the overall dosing systems and feed in decisions reached in the concept design phase. This shall include; \r\n\r\nControl Functional Specification\r\nTypical General Arrangement\r\nDosing Line Run Drawings\r\n \r\n \r\nDosing should be sized to achieve maximum of 1mg/L at peak flow.\r\nThe dosing system will be attended a minimum of once per week by operational staff.  Operational staff can supply and decant chlorine from 25L containers.  Appropriate delivery mechanism to be determined. Bulk chemical delivery may not be available under TSC's existing chemical supply contract.\r\n \r\nBase dosing size on 10 percent w/v hypochlorite strength.  This allows for some chlorine degradation as the chemical is delivered at a nominal 12.5 percent w/v.\r\n \r\nPackage system should include for degassing.\r\n \r\nPumps should be provided with 240v GPO plugs to allow easy changeover.\r\n \r\nTSC Designer will be responsible to confirm any tendered package dosing systems meets the control requirements as detailed in the functional description.  PID drawing will need to be updated to incorporate the package system controls.\r\n \r\nIt is anticipated that the package dosing system and instrumentation will be installed and commissioned by the Water Unit.  The Water Unit will procure the shed and slab if required.\r\nExclusions:  Injection rate control by downstream monitoring\r\nBuilding/shelter detailed design (concept only required as per scope, and only if needed).",

It has been determined that the Hillcrest Reservoir is a high priority location requiring a chlorine booster station.\r\n \r\nAt a \"Water Age and Chlorine Residual Review\" meeting attended by Water Unit Senior Engineers and Water Manager in December 2014 it was agreed that Sodium Hypochlorite will be the only chemical considered, that the dosing systems must be flow paced, that chlorine residual monitoring should be included in the installation, and that residual monitoring would be used as alarm and shutdown control only.

The Casino-Murwillumbah rail corridor was closed to rolling stock in 2004. In 2013 Transport NSW released its findings from the Casino to Murwillumbah Transport Study effectively killing off any plans for a return of rail services. This opened the door to convert the corridor to a 'rail trail' for use by cyclists and pedestrians. \r\n \r\nThe Tweed Stage of the Northern Rivers Rail Trail was identified as Council's second preference project for funding under the National Stronger Regions Fund Round 2 (behind the Kingscliff Foreshore Protection and Revitalisation Project).",

To provide adequate capacity to discharge treated effluent from Banora WWTP to Terranora Inlet for the current and ultimate plant capacity.\r\nProject Background:  The Banora Point WWTP was constructed to its current design capacity of 62,500 EP (15 ML/day) in 1995.  The plant is currently being upgraded to a capacity of 75,000 EP (18ML/d) with completion expected mid-2012.  The ultimate capacity of the plant is planned to be 125,000EP.\r\n \r\nTreated effluent from the plant is discharged to the Terranora Inlet at the Dry Dock, located on Dry Dock Road, Tweed Heads South.  Effluent is discharged from the plant to the outfall through approximately 1.7km of DN750 RCP.  A pumping lift station is located midway along the outfall pipeline.\r\n \r\nDischarge of effluent to the Terranora Inlet is restricted to a 4 hour window commencing 1 hour before each high tide and 3 hours following high tide.  This requirement is in place to maximise tidal discharge flushing and minimise nutrient accumulation within the Terranora Inlet. The plant currently operates to attenuate effluent flow within an effluent holding lagoon. The effluent holding lagoon is sized to contain 3 x ADWF.\r\n \r\nIt has been identified in Effluent Release System Hydraulic Review (MWH,2009) that the existing effluent outfall system has insufficient capacity to service current and future effluent flows.\r\n \r\nA realignment of a section of the existing DN750 outfall is proposed to be completed as part of Kirkwood Rd Interchange works scheduled to commence late 2011.  This realignment is not expected to significantly alter the existing outfall capacity.\r\n \r\nSignificant roadworks are planned around the existing Pacific Highway and Kirkwood Rd.  Additional bridge crossings of Terranora Ck are also proposed in future.  A concept design of the ultimate Highway and Kirkwood Rd interchange has been completed (by TSC).  A concept alignment for the location of a new Effluent Outfall Pipeline has been identified with respect to future roadworks.  The pipeline is proposed to be located on the north side of the highway then crossing back under the highway on Dry Dock Rd and discharging at the current outfall location.  This alignment would be considered the preferred alignment for any new pipeline option.",

Class B (6m wide seal) rural standard cross section (unless approved otherwise). Any culverts that are nearing the end of their service life may also be replaced (if within budget).\r\nProject Background:\r\nThe main access road for the Tweed valley sugarcane fields is Tweed Valley Way. Safety barriers installed along the centre of the road prevent turning movements for cane haulage trucks into the cane pads where harvested cane is stored. To access these pads the trucks must travel an increased distance along Tweed Valley Way to designated intersections where U-turns can be made. These truck movements present an increased risk of vehicle collision caused by the mixing of low speed accelerating/decelerating haul trucks with high speed through traffic.  Access to some cane pads located more remote from the main road is also affected by the available turning points through the safety barrier and is forced into a convoluted route.The net effect is excess travel time and distance for the haulage of cane from this area to the Condong Sugar Mill, and compromised road safety.An alternative route would be to utilise Bartletts Road. Use of this road would reduce travel distances and time, and minimize the number of truck turning and accelerating/decelerating movements on Tweed Valley Way. The intersection of Bartletts Road and Tweed Valley Way already includes a vehicle right turning/storage lane.  However, Bartletts Road is partially unsealed (2km). The unsealed section of the road is unsuitable for heavy transport, particularly during wet weather.\r\nExclusions:\r\nOther areas of Bartletts Road. Bridges on Bartletts Road (replaced in separate project)",

Multiple complaints from residents and motorists have been received by council. The issue has been on the Local Traffic Committee agenda since August 2009. Initially, efforts were made to change the intersection to a roundabout design, this was not feasible due to spatial constraints. A signalised intersection design was then proposed but the estimated $350 000 budget required was unable to be procured via the 'Black Spot' funding program as the intersection and crash history did not meet the requirements. Four design options, achievable within the budget and spatial constraints, were put to the Local Traffic Committee on 22 March 2012 for discussion. The committee agreed on an option and resolved to move towards a detailed design.",

The pipes are easily blocked, which causes the culvert to function as a causeway.

It also provides access to a number of businesses which rely on visitors access (such as Mavis's kitchen).

The amount of works to be undertaken will only be to allow the drainage canal to drain properly to Trutes Bay. The Gross Pollutant Trap before the outlet will also need to be cleaned as well. Any revegetation as part of the conditions set for mangrove clearing will also be undertaken.\r\nProject Background:  The outlet canal from a large underground urban stormwater system has become silted up and requires cleaning out. However the outlet canal drains through State Crown Land into Trutes Bay (Terranora Broadwater) and would require approximately 350m2 of mangrove habitat clearing. \r\n \r\nFrom previous investigation works conducted in 2010 a costly  Environmental Impact Assessment would be required to be undertaken from the Dept of Planning and potentially mangrove rehabilitation would be required elsewhere as compensation at a rate of 1:10. Also there was previously a drain (visible from 1960 and 1970s aerial imagery) that was maintained by the land owner prior to subdivision.  \r\n \r\nThe field inlet pit on western side of Frazer Drive (65m from outlet) is almost completely full which indicates that water is backing up the stormwater system and is not escaping. Also in the past the neighbouring residents have complained about mosquito breeding in the outlet canal due to water being so stagnant and TSC have to continually perform spraying in the area.",

This task will include the following key elements:\r\n\r\nGather information on chlorine demand and decay in the existing system.\r\nGather information on expected current and future water demands (minimum, typical and peak) \r\nObtain site plans and drawing of existing infrastructure.\r\nSizing of a packaged dosing facility for current and future needs.\r\nEnsure adequate mixing and chlorine detention times.\r\nDetermine if existing pump building can house the dosing system (if applicable). \r\nInvestigation of hypochlorite storage and supply issues.  Storages need to be sized to prevent degradation of hypochlorite but also to minimise purchase and delivery costs. Liaise with Water Operations with regards to existing and preferred methods of chemical supply and contracts.\r\nIdentify layout and design requirements that need to be adopted to ensure the facility operates effectively and without operational issues.\r\nDesign of dosing point\r\nDetermine safety measures required (including if a safety shower / eye wash station is required)\r\nIdentify any civil or other site issues.\r\nAddress site services, including electrical supply.\r\nPrepare PID and control functional description for operation of the dosing system. Liaise with Water Unit Operations area to determine control functional requirements.\r\nDetermine SCADA and PLC control requirements.  Detail requirements for Water Unit M and E section to procure and install.\r\nLiaise with Water Unit M and E section to determine specification requirements  to tender and procure suitable Chlorine Analyser.\r\nPrepare specification, tender and provide tender assessment of skid mounted hypochlorite dosing system (see below).\r\nProvide a Concept Design Report (may be part of Safety in Design Report).\r\n \r\nOther Dosing System Requirements and considerations\r\n\r\nLiquid Sodium Hypochlorite is to be the only chemical considered.\r\nDosing systems must be flow paced\r\nChlorine residual monitoring should be included in the installation\r\nResidual monitoring will be used for alarm and shutdown control only\r\nCheck existence/suitability of an existing flow meter (location, type, outputs, etc)  \r\nLiaise with Operations Engineer to determine any proposed adjustments to Reservoir control settings\r\nAppropriate chemical safety and signage requirements\r\nIf the dosing facility cannot be housed in the existing pump shed, it shall be housed in a kit style shed, with the concept and final designs providing the overall required shed size/layout, including the position and details of all openings (personal access doors, roller doors, windows, roof ventilation, etc.). Detailed design of shed and slab is not required.\r\nShed lighting, GPO's, water supply, etc.  \r\n \r\nA technical specification is to be prepared to include in tender documentation for the design and construction of the hypochlorite system. The technical specification should be suitably detailed to allow for the tendering and procurement of the required packaged Duty/Standby Liquid Sodium Hypochlorite Dosing System, along with relevant other components and equipment to be purchased.    \r\n \r\nThe specification will define the necessary performance requirements for the overall dosing systems and feed in decisions reached in the concept design phase. This shall include; \r\n\r\nControl Functional Specification\r\nTypical General Arrangement\r\nDosing Line Run Drawings\r\n \r\n \r\nDosing should be sized to achieve maximum of 1mg/L at peak flow.\r\nThe dosing system will be attended a minimum of once per week by operational staff.  Operational staff can supply and decant chlorine from 25L containers.  Appropriate delivery mechanism to be determined. Bulk chemical delivery may not be available under TSC's existing chemical supply contract.\r\n \r\nBase dosing size on 10 percent w/v hypochlorite strength.  This allows for some chlorine degradation as the chemical is delivered at a nominal 12.5 percent w/v.\r\n \r\nPackage system should include for degassing.\r\n \r\nPumps should be provided with 240v GPO plugs to allow easy changeover.\r\n \r\nTSC Designer will be responsible to confirm any tendered package dosing systems meets the control requirements as detailed in the functional description.  PID drawing will need to be updated to incorporate the package system controls.\r\n \r\nIt is anticipated that the package dosing system and instrumentation will be installed and commissioned by the Water Unit.  The Water Unit will procure the shed and slab if required.",

The Casino-Murwillumbah rail corridor was closed to rolling stock in 2004. In 2013 Transport NSW released its findings from the Casino to Murwillumbah Transport Study effectively killing off any plans for a return of rail services. This opened the door to convert the corridor to a 'rail trail' for use by cyclists and pedestrians. \r\n \r\nThe Tweed Stage of the Northern Rivers Rail Trail was identified as Council's second preference project for funding under the National Stronger Regions Fund Round 2 (behind the Kingscliff Foreshore Protection and Revitalisation Project).",

Class B (6m wide seal) rural standard cross section (unless approved otherwise). Any culverts that are nearing the end of their service life may also be replaced (if within budget).\r\nProject Background:\r\nThe main access road for the Tweed valley sugarcane fields is Tweed Valley Way. Safety barriers installed along the centre of the road prevent turning movements for cane haulage trucks into the cane pads where harvested cane is stored. To access these pads the trucks must travel an increased distance along Tweed Valley Way to designated intersections where U-turns can be made. These truck movements present an increased risk of vehicle collision caused by the mixing of low speed accelerating/decelerating haul trucks with high speed through traffic.  Access to some cane pads located more remote from the main road is also affected by the available turning points through the safety barrier and is forced into a convoluted route.The net effect is excess travel time and distance for the haulage of cane from this area to the Condong Sugar Mill, and compromised road safety.An alternative route would be to utilise Bartletts Road. Use of this road would reduce travel distances and time, and minimize the number of truck turning and accelerating/decelerating movements on Tweed Valley Way. The intersection of Bartletts Road and Tweed Valley Way already includes a vehicle right turning/storage lane.  However, Bartletts Road is partially unsealed (2km). The unsealed section of the road is unsuitable for heavy transport, particularly during wet weather.\r\nExclusions:\r\nOther areas of Bartletts Road.

Multiple complaints from residents and motorists have been received by council. The issue has been on the Local Traffic Committee agenda since August 2009. Initially, efforts were made to change the intersection to a roundabout design, this was not feasible due to spatial constraints. A signalised intersection design was then proposed but the estimated $350 000 budget required was unable to be procured via the 'Black Spot' funding program as the intersection and crash history did not meet the requirements. Four design options, achievable within the budget and spatial constraints, were put to the Local Traffic Committee on 22 March 2012 for discussion. The committee agreed on an option and resolved to move towards a detailed design.",

The pipes are easily blocked, which causes the culvert to function as a causeway. Mt Warning road provides access to the National Park and Mountain which is one of the major tourism generators for the region. It also provides access to a number of businesses which rely on visitors access (such as Mavis's kitchen). When the culvert functions as a causeway, visitors are not able to access, or deterred from accessing, theses facilites/businesses.\r\nExclusions:\r\nOther locations on Mt Warning Road.\r\n",

The amount of works to be undertaken will only be to allow the drainage canal to drain properly to Trutes Bay. The Gross Pollutant Trap before the outlet will also need to be cleaned as well. Any revegetation as part of the conditions set for mangrove clearing will also be undertaken.\r\nProject Background:  The outlet canal from a large underground urban stormwater system has become silted up and requires cleaning out. However the outlet canal drains through State Crown Land into Trutes Bay (Terranora Broadwater) and would require approximately 350m2 of mangrove habitat clearing. \r\n \r\nFrom previous investigation works conducted in 2010 a costly  Environmental Impact Assessment would be required to be undertaken from the Dept of Planning and potentially mangrove rehabilitation would be required elsewhere as compensation at a rate of 1:10. Also there was previously a drain (visible from 1960 and 1970s aerial imagery) that was maintained by the land owner prior to subdivision.  \r\n \r\nThe field inlet pit on western side of Frazer Drive (65m from outlet) is almost completely full which indicates that water is backing up the stormwater system and is not escaping. Also in the past the neighbouring residents have complained about mosquito breeding in the outlet canal due to water being so stagnant and TSC have to continually perform spraying in the area.",

Due to the long residence time of the system, chlorination at points throughout the network cannot be avoided. \r\n \r\nA determination of locations for chlorine booster stations has been made based on information from residual monitoring and water age modelling. It has been determined that the Hillcrest Reservoir is a high priority location requiring a chlorine booster station.\r\n \r\nAt a \"Water Age and Chlorine Residual Review\" meeting attended by Water Unit Senior Engineers and Water Manager in December 2014 it was agreed that Sodium Hypochlorite will be the only chemical considered, that the dosing systems must be flow paced, that chlorine residual monitoring should be included in the installation, and that residual monitoring would be used as alarm and shutdown control only.

This task will include the following key elements:\r\n\r\nGather information on chlorine demand and decay in the existing system.\r\nGather information on expected current and future water demands (minimum, typical and peak) \r\nObtain site plans and drawing of existing infrastructure.\r\nSizing of a packaged dosing facility for current and future needs.\r\nEnsure adequate mixing and chlorine detention times.\r\nDetermine if existing pump building can house the dosing system (if applicable). \r\nInvestigation of hypochlorite storage and supply issues.  Storages need to be sized to prevent degradation of hypochlorite but also to minimise purchase and delivery costs. Liaise with Water Operations with regards to existing and preferred methods of chemical supply and contracts.\r\nIdentify layout and design requirements that need to be adopted to ensure the facility operates effectively and without operational issues.\r\nDesign of dosing point\r\nDetermine safety measures required (including if a safety shower / eye wash station is required)\r\nIdentify any civil or other site issues.\r\nAddress site services, including electrical supply.\r\nPrepare PID and control functional description for operation of the dosing system. Liaise with Water Unit Operations area to determine control functional requirements.\r\nDetermine SCADA and PLC control requirements.  Detail requirements for Water Unit M and E section to procure and install.\r\nLiaise with Water Unit M and E section to determine specification requirements  to tender and procure suitable Chlorine Analyser.\r\nPrepare specification, tender and provide tender assessment of skid mounted hypochlorite dosing system (see below).\r\nProvide a Concept Design Report (may be part of Safety in Design Report).\r\n \r\nOther Dosing System Requirements and considerations\r\n\r\nLiquid Sodium Hypochlorite is to be the only chemical considered.\r\nDosing systems must be flow paced\r\nChlorine residual monitoring should be included in the installation\r\nResidual monitoring will be used for alarm and shutdown control only\r\nCheck existence/suitability of an existing flow meter (location, type, outputs, etc)  \r\nLiaise with Operations Engineer to determine any proposed adjustments to Reservoir control settings\r\nAppropriate chemical safety and signage requirements\r\nIf the dosing facility cannot be housed in the existing pump shed, it shall be housed in a kit style shed, with the concept and final designs providing the overall required shed size/layout, including the position and details of all openings (personal access doors, roller doors, windows, roof ventilation, etc.). Detailed design of shed and slab is not required.\r\nShed lighting, GPO's, water supply, etc.  \r\n \r\nA technical specification is to be prepared to include in tender documentation for the design and construction of the hypochlorite system. The technical specification should be suitably detailed to allow for the tendering and procurement of the required packaged Duty/Standby Liquid Sodium Hypochlorite Dosing System, along with relevant other components and equipment to be purchased.    \r\n \r\nThe specification will define the necessary performance requirements for the overall dosing systems and feed in decisions reached in the concept design phase. This shall include; \r\n\r\nControl Functional Specification\r\nTypical General Arrangement\r\nDosing Line Run Drawings\r\n \r\n \r\nDosing should be sized to achieve maximum of 1mg/L at peak flow.\r\nThe dosing system will be attended a minimum of once per week by operational staff.  Operational staff can supply and decant chlorine from 25L containers.  Appropriate delivery mechanism to be determined. Bulk chemical delivery may not be available under TSC's existing chemical supply contract.\r\n \r\nBase dosing size on 10 percent w/v hypochlorite strength.  This allows for some chlorine degradation as the chemical is delivered at a nominal 12.5 percent w/v.\r\n \r\nPackage system should include for degassing.\r\n \r\nPumps should be provided with 240v GPO plugs to allow easy changeover.\r\n \r\nTSC Designer will be responsible to confirm any tendered package dosing systems meets the control requirements as detailed in the functional description.  PID drawing will need to be updated to incorporate the package system controls.\r\n \r\nIt is anticipated that the package dosing system and instrumentation will be installed and commissioned by the Water Unit.  The Water Unit will procure the shed and slab if required.",
